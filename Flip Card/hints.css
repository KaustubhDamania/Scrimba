/* 

Hint 1:
There is :hover pseudo-class that applies styles when the mouse is hovered over it. 

Like this:
.card:hover {
     background: #fafafa
}

Hint 2:
Found transform css property, but only the back of the card is shown? 
This is because .back element is rendered after .front, so it gets covered,
use "backface-visibility: hidden;" to hide the back of the card.

Hint 3: 
You got the card flipped, but the wording is mirrored? Try researching 
"transform-style" property
